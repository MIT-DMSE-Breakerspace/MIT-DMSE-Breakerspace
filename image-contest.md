![Fall 2024 Microscope Image Contest](./assets/img/image-contest/image-contest.png) 

* ___$500___ first prizes in four categories!!!!
* Additional runner-up prizes

### Categories:

* __Most Instructive:__ Images that illustrate concepts important to your discipline and teach someone else about something you’re passionate about
* __Most Challenging:__ Images that require extra effort to prepare or image the sample, such as ion milling, sputter coating, temperature-controlled imaging, video or timelapse capture, and more. Additional documentation of the process is required
* __Best Optical Microscope Image:__ Artistic or beautiful images captured with the Breakerspace digital optical microscope
* __Best Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Image:__ Artistic or beautiful images captured with a scanning electron microscope in the Breakerspace

### How to enter:

1.	Sign up for a Breakerspace lab microscope training (If you’ve already trained, you’re one step ahead!): [breakerspace.mit.edu](https://breakerspace.mit.edu/)
2.	Capture your optical or scanning electron microscope images in the Breakerspace
3.	[Submit your entry here](https://forms.gle/26D7oqJJvAK5cKBG7) by Friday, November 8

### Judging criteria:

A panel of judges will evaluate entries based on the following criteria:

* Technical Merit: Judges will assess technical aspects of the capture such as clarity, focus, depth of field, contrast, and spatial resolution of the image
* Artistic Merit: This is where creativity and aesthetics count. Judges will consider composition, symmetry, and overall visual impact
* Context (as explained in the image caption): The caption should explain the relevance or background of the image. Judges will look for clarity and insight in the description — whether it helps viewers understand the significance of what is being shown. Additional supporting documentation to help convey context may be submitted

### Rules:

* All entrants must be currently enrolled MIT undergraduate students
* All entries must be captured using the microscopes in the DMSE Breakerspace, 8-102a
* Each winner will be eligible for one prize only, though multiple submissions will be accepted

### Deadline:

Submissions are due by Friday, November 8. Winners will be announced on Friday, November 22.
