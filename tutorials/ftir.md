### <a name="overview"></a> Overview:

The Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer provides an infrared spectrum of absorption or transmission of a solid, liquid, or gas, for identification, primarily, of organic or polymeric materials. This tutorial focuses primarily on use of the instrument with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory, which allows for easy sampling of materials in solid, semi-solid, powder, paste, and liquid forms.

### <a name="startup"></a> Instrument startup:

* Power on instrument, if needed
* Log on to instrument workstation using your MIT Kerberos
* Start OMNIC software
* Verify instrument connection via system status

### <a name="workflow"></a> Typical workflow:

Initially, and periodically as required:
* Clean ATR window
* Collect background (background will need to be refreshed periodically, the interval between background collections is configurable in software options)
* Clean ATR window

For each sample:
* Collect sample
* Clean ATR window
* Save sample spectrum
* Repeat as needed

### <a name="shutdown"></a> Instrument shut down:

* Save all data (each spectrum must be indvidually selected and saved)
* Close OMNIC
* Log off workstation
* Do not switch off (the manufacturer recommends leaving the instrument powered when not in use)

### <a name="materials"></a> Compatible materials:

* Any non-hazardous solid, semi-solid, powder, paste, and liquid materials
* Solvents needed to clean a sample off the instrument must also be non-hazardous 

_**If you have any questions about whether a material is appropriate to characterize in the Breakerspace, please ask before bringing it to the lab.**_

### <a name="sample-prep"></a> Sample preparation:

To maximize signal strength, it is important that the sample is in good contact with the entire ATR window. 

Solid samples should be smooth and free of contaminants on the face to be tested. The self-leveling pressure tip is typically most suitable for a solid sample. Cover the diamond window with the sample, position the pressure tower over the window, and tighten the turn the knob until the clutch slips to provide clamping pressure to the sample. Although many solid samples will not contaminate the window, it is still a good idea 

Common sample preparation technique for powders.
