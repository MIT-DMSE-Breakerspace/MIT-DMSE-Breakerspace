### <a name="overview"></a> Overview:

The Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer provides an infrared spectrum of absorption or transmission of a solid, liquid, or gas, for identification, primarily, of organic or polymeric materials. This tutorial focuses primarily on use of the instrument with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory, which allows for easy sampling of materials in solid, semi-solid, powder, paste, and liquid forms. The user guide for the spectrometer hardware can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rfba0x3swuhi4affsytv6/2638_iS5-UG.pdf?rlkey=mnjpwg72rbau8dsaw8jwg9flk&dl=0).

The software used to operate the iS5 is called OMNIC. This [_Getting Started_](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nhx1fk2ov5fpkz4og1guf/2640_OMNIC_GS.pdf?rlkey=93wld38wdscvv94o177jylilu&dl=0) guide has a useful list of tutorials and instructions on how to access them from within the software.

The full set of anufacturer's manuals and other training materials can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/n0zv4090ncohz1yd53zyp/AEk8_3vo2JuCcHDSDBEEjck?rlkey=haqbguq12kbmh8fi7jmi8wzvg&dl=0).

### <a name="startup"></a> Instrument startup:

The power indicator is a blue light on the left side if the instrument. If not lit, switch on the instrument with the switch on the left-rear of the instrument.

<img src="../assets/img/tutorials/ftir/ftir-switch.JPG" alt="FTIR power switch" style="width:33%;"> 

With the instrument switched on, log in (if not already logged in), and run the OMNIC software. Note that there is also a software package called OMNIC Specta, which can be used for additional analysis and search tools, but plain OMNIC is the software needed to run the spectrometer. Once OMNIC has started, look for a green check mark next to system status in the upper right corner. Clicking this will optionally open the _System Status Overview_ window.

### <a name="shutdown"></a> Instrument shut down

The manufacturer recommends leaving the instrument powered on, so all you need to do to shut down is be sure to save your data, close the software, and log off the computer.

### <a name="materials"></a> Compatible materials

The ATR accessory allows for easy sampling of solid, semi-solid, powder, paste, and liquid materials. The only requirement is that the materials, and any solvents needed to clean them off the instrument, are non-hazardous and safe to transport to and handle in the lab. If you have any questions about whether a material is appropriate to characterize in the Breakerspace, please do not hesitate to ask ahead of bringing it to the lab.

### <a name="sample-prep"></a> Sample preparation

The most important thing for collecting samples 

Common sample preparation techniques for solids.

Common sample preparation technique for powders.

Common sample preparation technique for liquids.

### <a name="tutorial"></a> Tutorial

Take the tutorial sample in drawer and load it in to the instrument. Find feature X and measure the dimensions. Perform operation Y and catalog results. What can be concluded from this data?
