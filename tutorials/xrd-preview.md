### Standard operating protocol: 

<a name="startup"></a> 

##### Instrument startup: - \<h5>

<a name="operation"></a>

##### Operation: 

* Select a measurement program
* Make sure your sample is level with the edge of the sample holder

</figure>

<a name="shutdown"></a>

#####  Instrument shut down:

* Clean sample holder
* Put glass covering back down
* Turn key
* Press power button

<a name="materials"></a>

* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info
* images/videos inline as needed

##### Sample Prep may be own sub-section:

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid

<a name="details"></a> 

### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>

### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="manuals"></a>
### Manufacturer's manuals:

* Links to manual files in dropbox

<a name="links"></a>
### Links:

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

<a name="exercises"></a>
### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.

### Using High Score Plus:

##### Determine background
* Treatment > Determine Background
* Automatic usually does the job.
* Granularity changes the distance between points of inflection on the background curve. A value around 20 is typically good. 
* Bending factor determines how bendy the background is (as the name suggests). 
* Click Accept.

## Determine peaks
* Treatment > Search Peaks
* Play with the significance until the peaks reflect what you think are peaks. 
* Under Peak List, go through the peaks detected to make sure the software didn’t make any mistakes. Delete peaks by Right Click > Delete Peak. 
Insert peaks by 
  * Option 1: Treatment > Insert Peak (Ctrl+R). Click on the tip of each peak you want to add. 
  * Option 2: In Peak Lists > Right Click > Add Peak…  and manually enter the data. 

## Determine a mystery compound:
* After determining the background and peaks,Right Click > Search Match > (Optional) change the search settings > Search > Ok.
* Options for improving your outcomes: 
  * Under the Restrictions tab > Restrictions set > Select Restriction set, you can pick your type of material from a drop down menu. For example, if you material is organic, select “Organic”
  * Under the Restrictions tab > Edit… will give you a pop up for many ways to restrict your search. For example, under Chemistry, one can input the elements that are or are not present in the sample. Ther
  * Clicking Execute Fitting > <Profile Fit> Default often improves the confidence and precision of the results. 
* Interpreting the Matches: 
Score shows the confidence of the program in the pattern match between your samples and the candidate. To check if the program was correct, click on the candidate you are interested in. Thin blue lines will show up on the graph. Check that each blue line matches up with the height and location of a peak of your sample. 
Once you are confident with your match, left click and pull it to the Pattern List panel. This “accepts” it. On the graph, if any peak is not matched by the accepted candidate’s pattern, it will retain a blue downward facing arrow on it. The candidates list reorganizes to find a compound that fits the unfitted peak. 
Continue this process until all peaks have been matched and all compounds in your sample have been found.
