### Sample Leveling:

Often samples are presented with a flat face to be analyzed, such as under a microscope or using XRD, that do not have a flat and/or parallel back surface to support them. In order to present the face of the sample optimally for characterization, it is necessary to use a sample leveling press. The general procedure is to place a weighing paper on the  press, place the sample on the weighing paper, add a small amount of Plastilina modeling clay to the back of the sample, add another weighing paper over the clay, and press it all together with the press. This forms the modeling clay to the irregular opposite side of the sample and gives the clay a flat face that is parallel to the sample face to be analyzed. If done properly, this should allow the entire sample to be viewed on a microscope with little to no refocusing necessary. 

The same press can be used with a small sample, XRD sample holder, and modeling clay to make sure the sample face is in the same plane as the face of the XRD sample holder.

This video demonstrates the basic operation, although this can be done successfully with much smaller quantities of modeling clay:
