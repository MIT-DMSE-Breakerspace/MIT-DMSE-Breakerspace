# Breakerspace Instrument Tutorial Template updated - tutorial title is \<h1>

## Overview - main overhead is \<h2>

Matches info/image for instrument on lab page, brief description of what it does/how it works/what materials it's used for

### Index: - sections are \<h3>

* Standard (daily) operating protocol
	* [Startup](#startup)
		* sequence of powering on, logging in, starting softare, homing/tilt position etc. - whatever might need to be done once at the start of a session
	* [Operation](#operation)
		* sample loading, data capture and saving, etc. - whatever might be repeated, characterization sequence
		* [anchor link where needed](#link-example)
	* [Shut down](#shutdown)
		* sequence to close/log off/power down as needed - whatever is done once at the conclusion of a session. highlight important steps in bold (ie. make sure UV-Vis lamp is OFF)
* Detailed operating instructions
	* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
	* <a name="link-example"></a> anchor link example
* Materials
	* compatible materials
	* sample prep - break into sub-sections as relevant, ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid
	* safety/handling related info
* Data processing and analysis
* Common failure modes
* Manufacturer manuals
	* software manual
	* hardware manual
* Links
	* good video tutorials, etc.
* Exercises
	* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
	* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
	* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.

### Standard operating protocol

#### <a name="startup"></a> Instrument startup:

* Procedure to start up the instrument
* these steps should only need to be completed once per session

#### <a name="operation"></a> Operation: 

* steps to characterize
* for instruments like SEM with multiple, independent characterization techniques (eg. EDS, imaging), make technique a top-level bullet and indent for steps
	* this is tabbed in to be a sub-set of the above bullet

#### <a name="shutdown"></a> Instrument shut down

* Procedure to shut down the instrument
* these steps should need to be performed once at the end of a characterization session

### <a name="materials"></a> Compatible materials

These are the categories of materials that can safely be characterized on this instrument.

These categories of materials should not be used.

### <a name="sample-prep"></a> Sample preparation

Common sample preparation techniques for solids.

Common sample preparation technique for powders.

Common sample preparation technique for liquids.
