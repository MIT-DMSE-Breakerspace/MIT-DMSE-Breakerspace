# Breakerspace Instrument Tutorial Template - tutorial title is \<h1>

## Overview - main overhead is \<h2>

Matches info/image for instrument on lab page, brief description of what it does/how it works/what materials it's used for

### Index: - sections are \<h3>

* Standard operating protocol - only this section should have sub-sections
	* [Startup](#startup)
	* [Operation](#operation)
	* [Shut down](#shutdown)
* Materials
* Detailed operating instructions
* Data processing and analysis
* Common failure modes
* Manufacturer manuals
* Links
* Exercises

### Standard operating protocol

#### <a name="startup"></a> Instrument startup: - subsections are \<h4>

* sequence of powering on, logging in, starting softare, homing/tilt position etc.
* these steps should only need to be completed once per session
* no images on page in this section, just text bullets, [text can link to image if needed](../assets/img/tutorials/template/ftir-switch.JPG)

#### <a name="operation"></a> Operation: 

* steps to characterize - sample loading, data capture and saving, etc. - whatever might be repeated, characterization sequence
* for instruments like SEM with multiple, independent characterization techniques (eg. EDS, imaging), make technique a top-level bullet and indent for steps
	* this is tabbed in to be a sub-set of the above bullet

#### <a name="shutdown"></a> Instrument shut down

* sequence to close/log off/power down as needed - whatever is done once at the conclusion of a session
* highlight important steps in bold (ie. __make sure UV-Vis lamp is OFF__)
* these steps should need to be performed once at the end of a characterization session

### <a name="materials"></a> Compatible materials:

* compatible materials
* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info

#### Sample Prep may be own sub-section

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid


### Detailed instructions:

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features

### Data processing and analysis

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials

### Common failure modes

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up

### Manufacturer's manuals

* Links to manual files in dropbox

### Links

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

### Exercises

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.

### <a name="loading"></a> Sample loading

Prepared samples, properly mounted in sample holder, are loaded using the following procedure...

### <a name="feature1"></a> Instrument feature

A key feature of this instrument is eg. focus stacking to create 3d image with height data

### <a name="tutorial"></a> Tutorial

Take the tutorial sample in drawer and load it in to the instrument. Find feature X and measure the dimensions. Perform operation Y and catalog results. What can be concluded from this data?
