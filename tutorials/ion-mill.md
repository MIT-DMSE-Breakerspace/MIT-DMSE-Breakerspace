# Breakerspace SEMPrep Ion Mill Tutorial

## Overview:

Our ion mill enables damage free sample prep for SEM imaging. It is equipped with two ion guns: a high-energy gun with a 2-16 keV range, and a low-energy gun with a 0.1-2 keV range. We have sample holders for polishing, and for 30° and 90° slope cutting, with a handy microscope to help with sample alignment. Our LN2 cooling option allows milling of heat-sensitive samples with good temperature control.

<a name="sop"></a>
### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* Turn the display on
* Turn the TMP's standby OFF
* In case the TMP's current consumption at 1500 Hz is higher than the usual, or >1 A, open the forevacuum pump's bypass valve for approximately 10 minutes
* Open the argon cylinder (in closet to left of instrument)
* Press _Purge (5s)_ four times, waiting five seconds between each click
* Needle valve _Semi-automatic_ control should be selected
* Open the needle valve for the ion gun you will use to allow it to reach the preset pressure, then let it close automatically
* Open the other ion source's needle valve if it will be used during today's operation

<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

##### Operation in semi-automatic operation mode:
* Prepare sample for [polishing](#polishing) or [slope cutting](#slope-cutting)
* Load sample
* Sample motion to be set
* Milling angle to be set
* Accelerating voltage to be set
* Milling time to be set
* Pressure must be <5x10<sup>-6</sup> mbar before turning on the ion source
* Turn the ion source on and the sample will be prepared
* Upon completion, [unload sample](#unload). Note that cooled samples should be allowed to return to ambient temperature before unloading

##### Operation in automatic operation mode:
* Prepare sample for [polishing](#polishing) or [slope cutting](#slope-cutting)
* Load sample
* Switch to the automated thinning mode in Settings\Thinning
* Open a recipe from the library, or create one
* Pressure must be <5x10<sup>-6</sup> mbar before a recipe is run
* Click "Run all steps" and the sample will be prepared according to the set steps
* Upon completion, [unload sample](#unload). Note that cooled samples should be allowed to return to ambient temperature before unloading

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* Ensure that all high-voltages are turned off
* Turn the sample movement off
* Tilt the sample back to 0&deg; milling angle
* Open the shutter plate
* Turn the camera and illumination(s) off
* Ensure that the needle valve is closed
* Turn the TMP's standby ON
* Close the argon cylinder
* Turn off the monitor


<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* compatible materials
* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info
* images/videos inline as needed

#### Sample Prep may be own sub-section:

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid

<a name="details"></a> 
### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="manuals"></a>
### Manufacturer's manuals:

* Links to manual files in dropbox

<a name="links"></a>
### Links:

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

<a name="exercises"></a>
### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
