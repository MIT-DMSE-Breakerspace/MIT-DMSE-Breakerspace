### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* [Power on the instrument](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/power-switch.JPG) [if needed](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/status-light.JPG)
* Log on to instrument workstation using your MIT Kerberos
* Open Mictrotrac FLEX software
* From the [_Open Analyzer_ menu select _Sync Analyzer_](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/connect.png)
* Wait while the instrument initializes

<a name="operation"></a> 
#### Operation:

* [Check the active database](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/database.png), [change/create new](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/database-change.png) if needed
* [Load measurement SOP](../assets/img/tutorials/psa/load-sop.png), if no SOP exists ask lab staff for assistance
* Clean loose particles from sample chamber 
* Load sample, 1/4 tsp for small sample tray
* Run Auto-Sequence
* Repeat as needed

<a name="shutdown"></a> 
#### Instrument shut down:

* Export data as needed
* Close the FLEX software
* Log off Windows workstation
* Instrument may be left powered on

<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* Any non-hazardous, dry powders with particles between 0.24 and 2,000 microns

### Detailed operating instructions:

#### Cleaning the sample area:

Loose particles in the sample area from previous samples can be pulled in to the instrument and skew your result. If there are particles to clean, lightly wet a Kimwipe with isopropanol and use it to wipe up loose particles. If needed, the sample tray and sample tray carrier can be removed for more careful cleaning. This video shows the cleaning process:

#### Loading a sample:








The sequence of steps to run a measurement is very straightforward: start the software, connect to the instrument, let it initialize, verify you are saving into the correct database, load a measurement SOP, clean the sample tray if needed and load a sample, run the auto-sequence, save your data, and close the software. 

Since the organization of the software can be confusing, this screen capture video shows the full sequence of steps needed to start the softare, initialize the instrument, and collect and export data. Don't forget, of course, to load your sample!
