### Standard operating protocol: 



<a name="startup"></a> 

##### Instrument startup: - \<h5> 

* Press the power button
* __One of the six loading ports must be empty when the machine is booted on__
* Turn the key to turn on the generator 


<a name="operation"></a>

##### Operation: 

* Select a measurement program
* Make sure your sample is level with the edge of the sample holder
* Name your sample
* Press "add to queue"
* Put the length of use, date, and userâ€™s name in log book
* Copy results in the data management tab
* Log onto desktop and open the shortcut folder
* Open the analysis software

<a name="shutdown"></a>

#####  Instrument shut down:

* Clean sample holder
* Put glass covering back down
* Turn key
* Press power button

<a name="materials"></a> 

### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* compatible materials
* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info
* images/videos inline as needed

##### Sample Prep may be own sub-section:

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid

<a name="details"></a> 

### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>

### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="manuals"></a>
### Manufacturer's manuals:

* Links to manual files in dropbox

<a name="links"></a>
### Links:

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

<a name="exercises"></a>
### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
