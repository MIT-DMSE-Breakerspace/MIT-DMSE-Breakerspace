# Breakerspace XRD Tutorial

## Overview:

Use our [Panalytical Aeris Research XRD](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/product-range/aeris-range) ([X-ray diffractometer](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/technology/xray-analysis/x-ray-diffraction)) to analyze properties such as phase composition, crystal structure, and orientation of solid samples, with precise results in less than five minutes.

<a name="sop"></a>
### Standard operating protocol: 

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup: 

* Make sure at least [one position in the sample changer is free](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/sample-changer.JPG) (no sample holder in place)
* Turn the mains power switch at the rear of the instrument
* Make sure that the cover is closed
* [Press the power button to switch on the instrument](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/power-button.JPG)
* Turn the [HT keyswitch](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/keyswitch.JPG) to switch on the HT generator


<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

* Prepare your sample externally at the sample prep table
* Put the sample holder in a loading position on the sample changer
* Select a measurement program from the drop-down list
* Put in a descriptive sample name
* Start the measurement
* Export results to networked workstation or USB drive
* Fill out your information in the X-ray safety log book
* Repeat as needed - additional samples can be loaded and added to the queue while current sample is being measured

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* Press the Power button to switch off the instrument
* Turn the HT Keyswitch counter-clockwise to switch off the HT generator
* If the instrument will be switched off for a long period of time, you can also switch off the mains power supply

<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* compatible materials
* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info
* images/videos inline as needed

#### Sample Prep may be own sub-section:

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid

<a name="details"></a> 
### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* Booting the instrument with all sample changer positions occupied will result in a somewhat [opaquely worded error](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/sample-changer-full.JPG)

<a name="manuals"></a>

### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
