# Breakerspace SEM Tutorial

## Overview

The Breakerspace has two scanning electron microscopes (SEM), a ThermoFisher [Phenom XL](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-xl.html) and [Phenom Pure](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-pure.html). 

[SEMs](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/what-is-sem-scanning-electron-microscopy-explained/) use a focused beam of electrons to image materials at much higher magnification than can be achieved with an optical microscope, with our instruments able to resolve features as small as 100 nm in optimum conditions. 

Our Phenom XL has a large 100x100 mm sample stage, a low vacuum mode for non-conducting samples, can perform [energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/edx-analysis-with-sem-how-does-it-work/), and also has a [tensile stage](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/MSD/Flyers/desktop-sem-tensile-sample-holder-FL0116.pdf) for in-situ observation of mechanical experiments. The Phenom Pure can observe a single sample on an 18 mm or smaller stub, under either low or high vacuum, and has a cold-stage for observation of frozen samples. Both instruments have [backscatter (BSD) and secondary electron (SED) detectors](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/sem-signal-types-electrons-and-the-information-they-provide/).

<a name="sop"></a>
### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* Log on to instrument workstation using your MIT Kerberos
* Start the Phenom User Interface software
* Wake the instrument up if needed
	* The first time you log on, and occasionally thereafter, you may need to connect to the instrument

<a name="operation"></a> 
#### Operation:

* _---Sample Prep---_
* Wear nitrile gloves when handling your sample, sample stages, and other sample preparation components
* Prepare samples externally at the sample prep table
* Firmly attach samples to stub
* Remove loose debris with compressed air
* _---Sample loading---_
* Load your sample(s) into the sample stage
* _Phenom XL:_ sample compartment is opened by pressing eject button in the software
* _Phenom Pure:_ sample compartment is manually opened and closed, but must be unlocked with the eject button in the software
* Set proper sample height
* _Phenom XL:_ set the tallest part of your tallest sample level with the opening of the sample stage, then lower by 6 notches on the dial
* _Phenom Pure:_ the tallest part of the sample should be just lower than the top edge of the sample stage
* Load the sample stage into the instrument
* Close the door and your sample should be visible in the NavCam
* _---Characterization---_
* Remove your gloves while using the computer
* Perform characterization relevant to your sample (image capture, measurement, EDS)
* Make sure any files you need are saved
* _---Sample unloading---_
* Wear nitrile gloves
* Open the sample compartment
* Remove sample(s)
* _Phenom XL:_ return sample stage to sample compartment, close door
* _Phenom Pure:_ close door, place sample stage in drawer


<a name="shutdown"></a> 
#### Instrument shut down:

* Close the software - press F11 to switch out of fullscreen view
* Log off Windows
* The instrument will put itself in standby

<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep:

* Samples should be free of volatiles (dry), excepting samples to be frozen on the Phenom Pure cold stage
* Samples must be free of loose particles ("flush" with compressed air)
* Samples must be well secured to a sample stub 
* Non-conductive samples can be viewed in low vacuuum mode, or sputter coated
* _Phenom XL_ maximum sample size is 100mm x 100mm x 35mm
* _Phenom Pure_ maximum sample size is a cylinder about 18mm diameter and 12mm tall

##### _If you have any questions about whether a material is appropriate to characterize in the Breakerspace, please ask before bringing it to the lab._

#### Solid sample prep (basic)

* Place a bare sample stub in a sample tray __ADD IMAGES__
* Attach a double-sided carbon pad to the stuf
* Attach the sample to the pad
* For an expanded discussion of sample prep techniques, see page 15 of [the manual](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iyd538gtkj79kg0bc8113/2020-MS-Phenom-XL_User-Manual.pdf.pdf?rlkey=0yk985nvgz3lckqnrtxwo7afv&dl=0)


#### Live Feed

When moving the camera around the sample, use the arrow keys for big jumps. Press control and the arrow keys for more precise movement, or click to center the camera on your cursor. To focus click the focus button in the bottom left corner. The brightness and magnification buttons are right above it. Right click the focus and brightness buttons to toggle between manual and auto adjustment. Right click and drag for precise adjustments and use the mouse wheel for large adjustments.

#### Acquisition

Press the camera icon on the left side of the screen to take an acquisition of the live feed. This picture will appear in the gallery menu in the top right. This is where you can see all the photos you have taken.

#### EDS

To use the EDS feature click on the squiggly line icon in the top right. Select a shape to measure along or inside in the menu on the left. The map option can be used to see where each element is located within the frame. A Table showing the atomic and weight concentrations of the area designated by the shape you drew will appear.

#### Live EDS

Click on the Live EDS icon in the top right. Click anywhere on the live feed to see the elemental makeup of that section by atomic and weight concentration. Click the square to stop data collection before navigating to a different section.

	* safety/handling related info

* Common failure modes
	* If you can't get the instrument to transition to SEM imaging, take your sample out and put it back in.

	* Before navigating away from an EDS make sure that it isnâ€™t active or else the instrument might lock itself in place. To resolve the issue, go back to the EDS, start it again, and turn it off.

	* If you have a brittle sample, you may have to use a low voltage and beam intensity to prevent damage.
