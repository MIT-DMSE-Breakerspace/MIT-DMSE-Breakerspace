The DMSE Breakerspace welcomes MIT undergraduates to explore the world of materials through hands-on experiences with powerful desktop materials characterization instruments. More than just a laboratory, it’s a dynamic hub for multidisciplinary learning, encouraging students to pursue their own questions. The Breakerspace also features a lounge for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying espresso — an inclusive space for academic exploration and leisure.

## Training and access:

**Open to All Undergraduates:** Regardless of your major or interests, Breakerspace welcomes all MIT undergraduates. Whether you’re a biologist, philosopher, or an economics major, satisfy your curiosity about the materials that make up the world—or just come in, make an espresso, and relax.


**Get Trained in Minutes:** User-friendly equipment ensures a low barrier to entry, making it easy for you to experiment and learn. [Sign up for training](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGpHiCqJ7jDvFa4AS-0jc4W5ePdHFoJUQFwze9eZ7DeGY2iQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Plan to spend about 30 minutes in the lab for an initial overview, plus training on one instrument. Once you have access, talk to one of our lab assistants to arrange a time to train on additional instruments, as needed.
